# Deploying a Dockerized Project to Hetzner Cloud

This document describes the general procedure for deploying a multi-service Docker Compose application to a Hetzner Cloud VPS. All section headings marked with `[CUSTOMIZE]` contain project-specific values that must be updated for each deployment.

---

## Prerequisites

- A [Hetzner Cloud](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) account
- A project repository with a `docker-compose.yml` and at least one `Dockerfile`
- SSH key registered in Hetzner Cloud
- Domain or static IP for the project (domain optional for early deployments)

---

## Step 1 — Provision the Server

### 1.1 Create a Cloud VM

In the Hetzner Cloud Console:

1. **New Server** → choose a datacenter region (e.g., `nbg1` Nuremberg or `fsn1` Falkenstein)
2. **Image**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
3. **Type** `[CUSTOMIZE]`: Start with the smallest instance that fits your workload:
   - `CX22` — 2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM — suitable for light workloads
   - `CPX21` — 3 vCPU / 4 GB RAM — better under sustained API load
   - `CPX31` — 4 vCPU / 8 GB RAM — multiple workers + DB on same host
4. **SSH Keys**: add your public key
5. **Firewall**: create a firewall rule set (see §1.2)
6. Click **Create & Buy**

### 1.2 Configure Firewall Rules

Create a Hetzner Firewall and attach it to the server. Open inbound TCP on the ports your services expose. Example baseline:

| Port | Protocol | Source    | Purpose                        |
|------|----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| 22   | TCP      | Your IP   | SSH access (restrict to your IP) |
| 80   | TCP      | Any       | HTTP (redirect to HTTPS if using Caddy/Nginx) |
| 443  | TCP      | Any       | HTTPS (reverse proxy)          |
| `[CUSTOMIZE]` | TCP | Any | Public service ports (API, frontend, etc.) |

> **Do not expose** database ports (5432), Redis (6379), or admin tools (e.g., Adminer on 8080) to the public internet. Use SSH tunnels for local access.

---

## Step 2 — Prepare the Server

SSH into the server as root (or a sudo user):

```bash
ssh root@<server-ip>
```

### 2.1 Install Docker CE

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg \
  | gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" \
  | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

apt-get update
apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Verify:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

### 2.2 Create a Non-Root Deploy User (Recommended)

```bash
useradd -m -s /bin/bash deploy
usermod -aG docker deploy
mkdir -p /home/deploy/.ssh
cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/deploy/.ssh/
chown -R deploy:deploy /home/deploy/.ssh
```

From now on, SSH as `deploy` rather than `root`.

---

## Step 3 — Deploy the Application

### 3.1 Clone the Repository

```bash
# [CUSTOMIZE] — replace with your repo URL and target directory
git clone https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git /opt/<project-name>
cd /opt/<project-name>
```

### 3.2 Create the Production Environment File

Copy the environment template and fill in all values:

```bash
# [CUSTOMIZE] — name of your example file may differ
cp .env.production.example .env
nano .env   # or use vim / any editor
```

Critical variables to set `[CUSTOMIZE]`:

```dotenv
# Application
APP_ENV=production          # Must be "production" — prevents dev-only routes from loading

# Database credentials — generate strong random passwords
POSTGRES_USER=<db_user>
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<strong_random_password>
POSTGRES_DB=<db_name>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<db_user>:<password>@pgbouncer:5432/<db_name>

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=redis            # Docker internal hostname; do not change if using Compose

# Public URLs — used at build time for frontend assets
# [CUSTOMIZE] — set to your server IP or domain
DASHBOARD_API_URL=http://<server-ip>:<api-port>
WS_URL=ws://<server-ip>:<api-port>
ALLOW_ORIGINS=http://<server-ip>:<frontend-port>

# External service API keys [CUSTOMIZE]
SOME_API_KEY=<value>
ANOTHER_SECRET=<value>
```

> **Security rule**: Never commit `.env` to Git. Verify `.gitignore` lists `.env` before the first deploy.

### 3.3 Build and Start Services

```bash
cd /opt/<project-name>
docker compose up -d --build
```

This will:
1. Build all images defined in `docker-compose.yml`
2. Start every service in the correct dependency order
3. Run one-shot jobs (e.g., database migrations) before the app starts

> **Note**: Code is baked into Docker images at build time. A plain `docker compose restart <service>` does **not** pick up code changes. Always use `--build` after a code update.

### 3.4 Verify the Deploy

```bash
# All services should show "Up" or "healthy"
docker compose ps

# Check that the migration job exited cleanly (exit code 0)
docker compose logs migrate

# Tail live logs from a specific service [CUSTOMIZE]
docker compose logs -f api
docker compose logs -f worker-default
```

---

## Step 4 — Updating the Application

For every subsequent code deploy:

```bash
cd /opt/<project-name>
git pull origin main                       # or your production branch
docker compose up -d --build               # rebuild changed images, restart services
docker compose logs migrate                # confirm migrations succeeded
docker compose ps                          # confirm all services running
```

If Docker's layer cache is serving stale code (rare but possible):

```bash
# [CUSTOMIZE] — replace <service> with the affected service name
docker compose build --no-cache <service>
docker compose up -d --no-deps <service>
```

---

## Step 5 — Reverse Proxy and HTTPS (Optional but Recommended)

For production deployments exposed to end users, add a reverse proxy in front of your services to handle TLS termination, domain routing, and port consolidation.

### Option A — Caddy (simplest, automatic HTTPS)

Install Caddy on the host (or add it as a Docker Compose service), then write a `Caddyfile`:

```
# [CUSTOMIZE]
yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:<frontend-port>
}

api.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:<api-port>
}
```

Caddy automatically provisions and renews Let's Encrypt certificates.

### Option B — Nginx

```nginx
# [CUSTOMIZE] /etc/nginx/sites-available/<project>
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:<frontend-port>;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Use Certbot for certificate management:

```bash
apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
```

---

## Step 6 — Data Persistence and Backups

Docker named volumes survive image rebuilds. The database data lives in a named volume defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
# [CUSTOMIZE] — check your docker-compose.yml for the actual volume name
volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

**Backup before any destructive operation:**

```bash
# Dump the database from inside the Postgres container [CUSTOMIZE]
docker compose exec postgres pg_dump -U <db_user> <db_name> > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

**Destroy everything including data** (use with caution):

```bash
docker compose down -v   # -v removes named volumes — irreversible
```

**Restore from a dump:**

```bash
cat backup_20260101.sql | docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U <db_user> <db_name>
```

---

## Step 7 — Scaling

### Vertical Scaling

Upgrade the Hetzner VM type in the console (requires a server restart):

```
CX22 (2 vCPU / 4 GB)  →  CPX21  →  CPX31  →  CPX41  →  CCX series
```

After resize, services restart automatically when the VM comes back up.

### Horizontal Worker Scaling

If your workers use a claim/lease job pattern (idempotent job execution), you can run multiple replicas with no code changes:

```bash
# [CUSTOMIZE] — replace worker-default with your worker service name
docker compose up --scale worker-default=3 -d
```

### Connection Pooling

Add PgBouncer between application services and Postgres when the number of Postgres connections becomes a bottleneck. Set `pool_mode = transaction` and configure max connections in `pgbouncer.ini`. Application services connect to `pgbouncer:5432` instead of `postgres:5432`. The migration service should always connect directly to `postgres:5432` (DDL safety).

---

## Step 8 — Common Operational Commands

```bash
# View running services
docker compose ps

# Follow logs for a service [CUSTOMIZE]
docker compose logs -f <service-name>

# Open a shell inside a running container [CUSTOMIZE]
docker compose exec <service-name> bash

# Run a database query (psql is not in app containers — use the postgres container)
docker compose exec postgres psql -U <db_user> -d <db_name>

# Force-rebuild one service without rebuilding others
docker compose build --no-cache <service>
docker compose up -d --no-deps <service>

# Restart a service (no code reload — for config-only changes)
docker compose restart <service>

# Stop everything (keeps volumes)
docker compose down

# Stop everything and wipe data (IRREVERSIBLE)
docker compose down -v
```

## Deployment Checklist

Use this before every production deploy:

- [ ] `.env` file is present on the server and not committed to Git
- [ ] `APP_ENV=production` is set
- [ ] Database credentials are strong and unique
- [ ] All external API keys and secrets are populated
- [ ] Public-facing URLs in `.env` match the actual server IP or domain
- [ ] Firewall rules block database and admin ports from public access
- [ ] `docker compose ps` shows all services healthy after deploy
- [ ] Migration logs show clean exit (`Alembic upgrade head` with no errors)
- [ ] A database backup exists before any schema-changing migration
- [ ] `.gitignore` includes `.env`, logs, and any generated artifacts

## Architecture Reference

The pattern used in this project and this guide follows a **single-host Docker Compose** topology:

```
Internet
  │
  ├─ :80/:443  → Reverse Proxy (Caddy/Nginx) [optional]
  │                │
  │                ├─ Frontend        (Next.js / static)
  │                └─ API             (FastAPI / Express / etc.)
  │
  ├─ :XXXX    → Direct port access (pre-proxy phase)
  │
Hetzner VM
  ├── api              (web server)
  ├── dashboard-api    (secondary API, optional)
  ├── frontend         (SSR or static frontend)
  ├── worker-*         (background job workers)
  ├── postgres         (database, internal only)
  ├── redis            (queue broker, internal only)
  ├── pgbouncer        (connection pooler, optional)
  └── adminer          (DB admin, localhost only)
```

All services communicate over a Docker Compose internal network. Only explicitly mapped ports are reachable from the host.

## R2R-Specific Deployment Decisions (filling in this guide's `[CUSTOMIZE]` markers)

This app has never been deployed before — no `docker-compose.yml`/`Dockerfile` exists yet in this repo (as of 2026-08-11). These are the concrete decisions for when that work starts, recorded here so the reasoning isn't re-derived from scratch. See `PROGRESS.md` M66 for the observability/concurrency work (rate limiting, Redis-backed queue, admin stats) that was built ahead of deployment.

### URL topology: one domain, not two

Four services, only two get a public URL:

| Service | Public URL? |
|---|---|
| Frontend (Vite/React build) | Yes — served at `/` |
| Backend API (Express) | Yes — reverse-proxied at `/api/*`, same domain |
| Postgres | **No.** Internal Docker network only, no host port binding to a public interface. |
| Redis | **No.** Same — internal only. |

**Recommendation: single domain with path-based routing** (`yourdomain.com/` → frontend static build, `yourdomain.com/api/*` → backend container), not the two-subdomain pattern (`app.` / `api.`) shown in this guide's Option A example. Reasoning: one DNS record, one TLS cert, and same-origin requests mean no CORS configuration is needed at all. The subdomain split earns its complexity when frontend and backend need independent scaling or deploy cadence — neither applies at this app's current scale (single/few users). Revisit only if there's a concrete reason (e.g., wanting the public portfolio-sharing pages on a distinct branded URL from the authenticated app).

### Postgres and Redis: internal-only, not "two more apps with URLs"

Per this guide's own checklist ("Do not expose database ports... or Redis... to the public internet"): both run with no `ports:` mapping to `0.0.0.0` in the production compose file. If admin access is ever needed from a dev machine, use an SSH tunnel, not a public port — same rule this guide already states for Postgres, applied identically to Redis.

**Action item before this ever touches a real server**: the local dev Redis container (`portfolio-redis`, used for the M66 concurrency queue) has no password (`redis:7-alpine` with no `--requirepass`). Fine on localhost-only; must get a password set via `requirepass` (and `REDIS_URL` updated to include it) as part of the production compose file — an unauthenticated Redis instance is a well-known, fast-exploited target if it's ever accidentally exposed.

### Colaberry live-login: Docker socket tradeoff (unresolved)

`services/colaberryLiveLoginSessionManager.js` shells out to the `docker` CLI directly to spawn/tear down per-session browser containers. If the backend runs in its own container, it needs `/var/run/docker.sock` mounted in to keep controlling sibling containers — which is effectively root-equivalent host access from inside that container. Two options, not yet decided:
1. Mount the socket — full feature parity, larger blast radius if the backend container is ever compromised.
2. Skip live-login on the first deploy — smaller attack surface, but the Colaberry-import flow that depends on a live-login session becomes unavailable on the server until this is resolved (e.g., a separate, more isolated small VM just for that feature).

### Still open

Hetzner account state (starting fresh vs. already provisioned), and domain vs. raw IP for the first pass — neither has been decided yet.

## Instructions to create new SSH key and instructions to create and use dedicated keypair per repo and implement it for git repo access

# Part A — Creating a new SSH key
Same command whether it's for your own machine (server login) or on the server itself (repo deploy key) — just pick a distinct filename so you don't overwrite an existing key.

On Windows (PowerShell) — for logging into a new Hetzner server:


ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "kes-hetzner-<project-name>" -f "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\hetzner_<project-name>"
-t ed25519 — modern, fast, smaller than RSA; use -t rsa -b 4096 only if a target system doesn't support ed25519 (rare)
-C — a comment/label, not a secret; makes it identifiable later in authorized_keys or GitHub's key list
-f — explicit filename so it doesn't prompt to overwrite id_ed25519
Leave the passphrase empty only if this key will be used non-interactively (e.g., a deploy key on a server); use a passphrase for your personal daily-driver key
This produces two files: hetzner_<project-name> (private — never leave your machine) and hetzner_<project-name>.pub (public — safe to paste anywhere).

On the Ubuntu server (Bash) — same idea, used in Part B for a deploy key:


ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deploy-<repo-name>" -f ~/.ssh/deploy_<repo-name> -N ""
-N "" sets an empty passphrase — required here since nothing will be typing it in interactively during git pull.

Add the private key to your local agent if you generated it on Windows for server login:


ssh-add "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\hetzner_<project-name>"

# Part B — Dedicated deploy keypair per repo, wired into git access
This runs on the Hetzner server, since that's the machine doing the git clone/git pull.

1. Generate the keypair (as above):


ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deploy-<repo-name>" -f ~/.ssh/deploy_<repo-name> -N ""
2. Print the public key and copy it:


cat ~/.ssh/deploy_<repo-name>.pub
3. Add it to GitHub as a Deploy Key (repo-scoped, not account-wide):

GitHub repo → Settings → Deploy keys → Add deploy key
Paste the public key
Leave "Allow write access" unchecked unless the server needs to push (it shouldn't, for a deploy target)
Save
4. Tell SSH which key to use for this repo, since GitHub only sees git@github.com and can't otherwise tell your deploy keys apart. Edit ~/.ssh/config on the server:


Host github.com-<repo-name>
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/deploy_<repo-name>
    IdentitiesOnly yes
IdentitiesOnly yes is important — without it, SSH may try your other keys first and GitHub will reject them before reaching the right one if you have several deploy keys on the box.

5. Clone using the alias host, not github.com directly:


git clone git@github.com-<repo-name>:<org>/<repo-name>.git /opt/<repo-name>
Existing repo already cloned with a plain URL? Repoint its remote instead of re-cloning:


cd /opt/<repo-name>
git remote set-url origin git@github.com-<repo-name>:<org>/<repo-name>.git
6. Verify:


ssh -T git@github.com-<repo-name>
Expect: Hi <org>/<repo-name>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access. — confirming it authenticated as the deploy key, scoped to that one repo.

7. Lock down permissions (SSH silently ignores keys with overly-open perms):


chmod 600 ~/.ssh/deploy_<repo-name>
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/deploy_<repo-name>.pub
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
From here, git pull on that server only ever touches this one repo, read-only — if the box is compromised, the blast radius stops at this repo instead of every repo your personal account can reach.
